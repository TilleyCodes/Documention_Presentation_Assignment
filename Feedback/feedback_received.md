**Feedback from:** Brendon & Tanya    
**Date of feedback:** 04/12/2024   
**Feedback Provided:**   
- In the CurrencyConverter class, it might be usfule to add some extra error messages for cases like invalide currency codes, so users can understand what went wrong.  
- Possibly include a section in the ReadMe that touches on any ethic considerations, like how the app ensures fair exchange rates and how it handles user's data.  
- Code comments - module level docstrings and clarity on classes.

**Actions to be complete based on feedback:**  
- It would be helpful to add some user-friendly error messsages in the CurrencyConverter class for errors such as unrecognised currencies.  
Maybe prompt users to try again if they make a mistake.  
- A small section in the ReadMe about ethical considerations would be great addition, letting users know how you ensure the exchange rates are fair and how you handle any date privacy.  
- Review of code comments

**My notes and plan of action based on feedback:**  
- Error messages for incorrect currency code input are captured in currency_converter_functions.py - no action  
- The application captures real-time exchange rate base on the market using APi key from http://api.exchangeratesapi.io. - updated in ReadMe with a link to license & service agreement   
- Review code comments - reviewed and updated to include code examples

**Specific documentation checked:** Currency Converter Terminal CLI Application
**Feedback from:** Angus & Chris
**Date of feedback:** 04/12/2024 
**Feedback Provided:** 
- Readme - Installation instructions are very clear (great for none coding users!)
- application is easy to use and easy to navigate ( i couldn't get the convert currencies using live FX rate working but everything else was simple and easy to use)
- only suggestion is maybe add a check after the first currency code (AUD) is selected to let me know that it has worked
- overall great application and would use in my travels

**Feedback Provided:** This Class is very comprehensive and well written and does exactly as intended. Very detailed notes explain all aspects of the code and answer any question I would’ve had about it. I am honestly hard up for feedback great use of error to handling, JSON serialisation using best practise, and each method has it’s own responsibility and doing so well and concisely.
