- Your readme file looks good, you have explained the purpose and features of the application and steps to install python and clone from the repository.  
- I think what is missing are the steps to install the libraries / packages for example, colored. Also any ethical considerations & standards.  
- For your code comments in colored.py - I believe using the #comments are correct but I would maybe put it above the import line and maybe add the purpose of the import.  
- For the code comments, I'm not seeing the full code in main. What you have there explaining each code line is good.   
- I don't see this in your code comment but just make sure you add comments to the classes and functions explaining the purpose, returned result and parameters / arguments.  

**Actions to be complete:**  
- Update ReadMe to include installation for libararies / packages, dependencies and licenses and an ethical consideration & standards - since this a Bank Management system, you may want to consider the users privacy and look up PII.  
- Add code comments to classes and function explaining the purpose, returned result and parameter / arguements - for HD standar include code examples as well.

- You have provided an explanation for all code lines which meets the requirements for HD.  
- However, do an online search on documentation commetns or docstring code comments - the correct way to comment in code is to use the triple double quotes “““your comments””” this method will link to the comments to the functions.  
- You had a comment for parameters: string in the typewriter function, I believe this is classified as an argument in the function so maybe change it to argument so it aligns with the assignment code comment brief.  
- Your comment using # for import is perfect.  

**Actions to be complete:**
- Update code comment for typerwriter function in triple double quotes.  
- check parameter / argument.

- The readme does a great job covering the features of the application, walking through every feature and giving an in-depth explanation of
what information to give, the format in which it needs to be given and how to read the results of the output.  
- The troubleshooting section at the end of the readme is a great touch.  
- The clear notes at the ends of each section when it comes from what would be a frequently asked question is very clear to other developers.  

**Actions to be complete:**  
- I feel like the purpose of the application could be expanded upon in the first paragraph of the readme, it states “taking health outputs and rating before starting and picking back up an exercise journey” but I
feel like there could be many more uses/more specific details; e.g. journaling weight and bmi loss on a fitness journey, tracking current or past health issues, etc  
- I also feel like the installation guide could also be a bit more in-depth, installing python is straightforward but providing a guide or a link to a guide may be a bit clearer, similar note to any of the dependencies in the application, a guide to installing them through pip would be clearer to other developers.

ReadMe:
- The overview for the app in the Readme is perfect, states the purpose of the app succinctly and clearly states the targeted users, features, and limitations of the application.  
- The installation guide in the Readme is very well formatted and readable, the code snippets keep everything looking very clean and professional, overall making for an easy installation process for any developer.
- The Application Features section of the Readme provides a greatly detailed description of the capabilities of the application and the error handling and input validation showing the limitations and common errors associated with using the application.  
Functions Feedback:  
- All functions, both code and comments, are very well formatted, structured and organised, making it very readable and very easy to follow for any developer. The purpose of the functions are clearly stated within the comments above them leaving little to no room for error when going through the code. You’ve also gone into great detail explaining the parameters within the functions themselves.
Classes Feedback:  
- Similar to the functions, the classes code and comments are extremely well formatted and clean to read, and the comments are very clear on the purpose, arguments and attributes of the classes as required by the rubric. The comments throughout the classes also do a great job of explaining the purpose, returned data, examples and implementation details of the classes and have extensively covered all requirements
set out by the rubric.

**Actions to be complete:**
- In the functions comments I feel like you could elaborate more on the examples of the returned results of the functions themselves, eg. with the save_menu function within the file_funtions, you’ve mentioned an example that it saves it into the kitchen menu in a JSON file but maybe you could elaborate more on what that looks like within the JSON file.
