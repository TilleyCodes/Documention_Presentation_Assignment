- Your readme file looks good, you have explained the purpose and features of the application and steps to install python and clone from the repository. 
- I think what is missing are the steps to install the libraries / packages for example, colored. Also any ethical considerations & standards.
- For your code comments in colored.py - I believe using the #comments are correct but I would maybe put it above the import line and maybe add the purpose of the import
- For the code comments, I'm not seeing the full code in main. What you have there explaining each code line is good. 
- I don't see this in your code comment but just make sure you add comments to the classes and functions explaining the purpose, returned result and parameters / arguments.
**Actions to be complete:**
- Update ReadMe to include installation for libararies / packages, dependencies and licenses and an ethical consideration & standards - since this a Bank Management system, you may want to consider the users privacy and look up PII
- Add code comments to classes and function explaining the purpose, returned result and parameter / arguements - for HD standar include code examples as well.

**Specific documentation checked:** Code Comments for typerwrite.py

- You have provided an explanation for all code lines which meets the requirements for HD.
- However, do an online search on documentation commetns or docstring code comments - the correct way to comment in code is to use the triple double quotes “““your comments””” this method will link to the comments to the functions
- You had a comment for parameters: string in the typewriter function, I believe this is classified as an argument in the function so maybe change it to argument so it aligns with the assignment code comment brief
- Your comment using # for import is perfect
**Actions to be complete:**
- Update code comment for typerwriter function in triple double quotes
- check parameter / argument
